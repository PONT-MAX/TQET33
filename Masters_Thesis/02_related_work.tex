\section{Related work}
In this section important, relevant and fundamental articles to this master's thesis is presented each with a summary. The articles covers compressed sensing theory applied to compressed imaging, SPC architecture and how to evaluate the images i.e. the fundamental source of information on how to build a state of the art SPC system and how to evaluate its performance. 

\subsection{Compressive sensing}


\subsection{Compressive imaging}
\begin{itemize}

    \item In~\cite{article:CS_donoho1} David L. Donoho proposed the framework of compressed sensing and its application to images.
    
    \item 

    \item \cite{article:SRM} Fast and Efficient Compressive Sensing Using Structurally Random Matrices. Describes that SRM works and why.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Al Boviks book the essential guide to image processing \cite{book:image_processing} contains the majority of fundamental image processing techniques and measurements. Two image quality metrics of interest is PSNR and SSIM which can be used when a reference image is available.
    
    \item \cite{article:il_niqe} A Feature-Enriched Completely Blind Image
    Quality Evaluator describes how the no reference image quality assessment tool IL-NIQE works and compares to other NR-IQA algorithms. In the article a comparison with other state of the art NR-IQA is conducted which concludes that IL-NIQE is the best over all NR-IQA tool. This kind of QA is useful when there is no reference image available, which is true when taking photos with the SPC.
