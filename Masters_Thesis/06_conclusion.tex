Explicit answers to research questions and a summary of the whole masters thesis.

\subsection{Conclusion}

\subsection{Future work}
This thesis shows that there is possible to use the SPC architecture to capture and reconstruct natural scenes in daylight, but for the technology to be used in a realistic application some improvements need to be made. And I think the most crucial problems could be "bought out" by more sophisticated hardware.\\[0.1in]

As identified multiple times in this thesis, the largest contributor to decreased image quality is exposure time and noise. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Better sensor with lower background noise, preferably of CCD type where each measurement matrix light intensity over the exposure time gets integrated and read out, which would lower the noise.

\item A faster DMD to shorten the exposure time to under a second, this would reduce most of the problems with the current setup which comes from a non static scene.

\item A GPU accelerated reconstruction algorithm, to shorten the reconstruction time.

\item A automatic system to measure and reconstruct the image
