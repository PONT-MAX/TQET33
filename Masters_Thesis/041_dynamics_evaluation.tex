\subsubsection{Dynamics in scene}
\label{sec:dyn_sim}
In the SPC setup, the exposure time was between 10 to 50 seconds, which increased the risk of dynamics in the scene. Dynamics in the scene reduces the reconstruction performance because the scene is assumed to be constant. By simulating dynamic scenes in a controlled environment, their individual effects to the sampled signal $\mathbf{y}$ could be identified and evaluated. As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:Dynamics_in_scene} dynamics in the scene can roughly be divided into two separate categories, luminance change and movement. In this section, global luminance change and two kinds of movement are simulated. The goal was to see how the signal changes when dynamics are introduced in the scene. In the case of luminance change, the moving mean algorithm presented in section~\ref{sec:Dynamics_in_scene} was evaluated.\\[0.1in]

To generate a simulated measurement representing a dynamic scene each sample $\mathbf{y}[m]$ is constructed using a unique image $\mathbf{x}_m$, which has been changed from the previous image,

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{y}[m] = \mathbf{\phi}_m\mathbf{x}_m.
\end{equation}

In the first scenario an object was placed in an image, but for each measurement the location of the object was be moved in a small bounded area of the image. Consequently, his model represents a scene where the background is static with a person moving in a small area.

\end{figure}

As seen in figure~\ref{fig:local_sig_1} there was no obvious difference between the non perturbed reference signal and the distorted signal. Neither in the zoomed in view in figure~\ref{fig:local_sig_2}, any large difference can be seen.\\[0.1in]

The reconstructed images from the reference signal and the perturbed signal are displayed in figure~\ref{fig:local_2} and \ref{fig:local_3}, respectively. The difference between the images are visible to the naked eye. Not only does the moving object get blurry and noisy, but the whole image globally.

\end{figure}

In table~\ref{tab:local_dyn} the results from calculating PSNR and SSIM of the the reconstructed images are presented. It can be observed that the dynamic test image has been affected to some degree by the movement.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering

  \end{tabular}
      \caption{Evaluation comparing a unperturbed reconstructed images against reconstructed images with local movement.}
    \label{tab:local_dyn}
\end{table}


%The conclusion of this test implies that local movement in a scene will cause noise in the image globally and especially locally where the movement occurred. It also implies that local movement is very hard to detect in the signal even if a reference signal is available.\\[0.1in]



%%%%%%%%%% Second scenario %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The second scenario is an object passing through the whole scene. The problem is modeled with a static background and a simulated object crossing the whole scene, like a car, human or animal might do when using the SPC. The object will cross the scene in 1000 measurements of approximately 19000 in total which corresponds to approximately $0.7$ seconds, when sampling with the SPC in its current setup.\\[0.1in]

    \caption{(a) Pertubated signal from large movement on top of the reference signal. (b) Zoomed in view of some samples from figure (a).}
    \label{fig:fly_sig}
\end{figure}

As seen in figure~\ref{fig:fly_sig}, at measurement 1000 the exact moment the object enters the scene, the signal changes. This is because a completely new structure has entered the scene and therefore the DC level changes. It can also be noted that after a while the object passed something which has approximately the same intensity as the background and therefore the DC signal almost returns to its original value for a brief moment.\\[0.1in] 

In figure~\ref{fig:fly_dyn} the effect of the moving object can be seen in the reconstructed image, which has gained a lot of global noise. Note that the object passing trough can not be seen because there is more measurements of the background than of the moving object. Nevertheless, the object is creating uncertainty in the whole image, resulting in global noise.

    \label{fig:fly_dyn}
\end{figure}

In table~\ref{tab:fly_dyn} the results from calculating PSNR and SSIM of the reconstructed images are presented. It can be observed that the image has been effected heavily by the movement, lowering the SSIM index to 0.58. 


\begin{table}[H]

  \begin{tabular}{ | l | l |}

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
      \caption{Evaluation comparing unperturbed reconstructed image against reconstructed image with movement.}
    \label{tab:fly_dyn}
\end{table}


%Obviously in this context the samples with movement is very easy to spot and the easiest fix would be to just remove those measurements, reconstructing an image with fewer measurements. The resulting image would not be as good as the image in figure~\ref{fig:fly_2} but it would not be contain the noise present in figure~\ref{fig:fly_3}.\\[0.1in]



%%%%%%%%%%%% Third %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The third scenario is luminance change in the scene caused by inconsistency of light intensity from the source. Outdoors this means that the light intensity from the sun will vary over time, the most obvious being clouds occluding the sun but for example even change in air density can change the intensity. This scenario is modeled by adding or subtracting the global intensity in the image over the measurements. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{result/dynamic/lum/intense_change1.eps}
    \caption{Signal effected by light intensity change on top of reference signal.}
    \label{fig:lum_sig_1}
\end{figure}

As seen in figure~\ref{fig:lum_sig_1}, the DC level of the signal will slowly change, but the structure of the signal stay the same. In figure~\ref{fig:lum_dyn} the reconstructed images from the perturbed signal and the reference signal are displayed. The reconstructed image from the dynamic signal has gained a lot of global noise even though the structure in the image has not been changed over the measurements.

(b) Reference image reconstructed from the original image without light intensity change. (c) Reconstructed image from a scene with global light intensity change over the measurements.}
    \label{fig:lum_dyn}
\end{figure}

In section~\ref{sec:Dynamics_in_scene}, a model of this problem was proposed along with an algorithm to suppress the impact of global luminance change. The algorithm is applied to this experiment to evaluate its performance. The moving mean subtraction method is applied and in figure~\ref{fig:lum_sig_2} the resulting signal is plotted over the dynamic signal. Note that the processed signal is stationary again. In figure~\ref{fig:lum_sig_3} and \ref{fig:lum_sig_4}, where the processed signal is plotted over the reference signal, it can be seen that the processed signal has gained its original structure and almost fit exactly to the original.

\end{figure}

In figure~\ref{fig:lum_rec}, the processed signals reconstructed image is displayed between the reference and perturbed signals reconstructed images. The moving mean algorithm improve the reconstruction significantly, the image has gained some noise compared to the reference image, but over all there is not much difference between them.
